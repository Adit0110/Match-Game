# Match-Game

This is a simple memory-based match game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to find and match pairs of cards by flipping them over.

## Features

- **Card Flipping Animation:** Click to flip cards and reveal the symbols.
- **Matching Logic:** If two flipped cards match, they remain open; otherwise, they flip back.
- **Game Logic:** The game tracks the player's moves and automatically resets when all pairs are found.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is responsive and works on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the game.
- **CSS3**: Styling, layout, and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic and interactions.

## How It Works

1. The game board is a grid of cards placed face-down.
2. The player clicks on a card to flip it over and reveal its symbol.
3. The player then clicks a second card:
   - If the symbols match, both cards stay face-up.
   - If they do not match, both cards flip back after a short delay.
4. The game continues until all pairs are matched.
